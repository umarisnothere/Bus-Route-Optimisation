# Bus-Route-Optimisation
Before anything this is not an anroid application but a c++ program, i made it by seeing the huge distances that we have to take in buses through long routes when we can switch buses and travel faster and cheaper.
In Bus Route Optimisation you can navigate Bhopal's bus network . This C++ program, powered by Dijkstra's algorithm, calculates the shortest distance and fare between selected bus stops, ensuring a seamless and cost-effective journey.
Features:
•	Optimized Routes: Discover the most efficient path from your starting point to your destination.
•	Fare Calculation: Get accurate fare details based on the total distance traveled.
•	User-Friendly Executable: Simply run the provided executable (bhopal-bus-route-optimization.exe) for a hassle-free experience.
•	Lexicographically Ordered Stops: Stops are organized in lexicographical order for easy search and identification.
How to Use:
1.	Download the Executable:
•	Download the executable from the Releases section.
2.	Run the Executable:
•	Double-click on bhopal-bus-route-optimization.exe to launch the program.
3.	Input Bus Stop Codes:
•	Follow the on-screen instructions to input source and destination bus stop codes.
4.	Receive Optimization:
•	The program will output the shortest route and associated fare.
Bus Stop Codes:
Bus stops are marked with codes for easy input. Stops are organized in lexicographical order to facilitate search and selection.
